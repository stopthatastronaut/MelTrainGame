# The Melbourne Train Game

Inspired by our local pub trivia, which has regular questions on which station is on which line, this little website lets you practice your Melbourne Train Network knowledge and ace your next pub quiz.

Well, that one question, anyway.

## Data

Originally scraped data from the [PTV Timetable API](https://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index). The game itself is in AlpineJS.

## Improvements to come

- Persist your scores over time, instead of just per-session
- Show a map when you get an answer correct
- Share buttons
- Remember what you've seen in the recent session, to make repeats less likely
